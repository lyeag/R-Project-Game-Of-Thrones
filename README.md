# Game-Of-Thrones-Effect-On-Tourism
I was interested in how GOT has effected tourism across the world given it was filmed in a variety of popular and previously unknown locations. I looked to TripAdvisor to gauge popularity over time and divided the reviews into groups depending on the occurence of GOT references.
## Finding and Preparing the Data from TripAdvisor
In order to get the reviews for the attractions featured in GOT I had to scrape the data from Tripadvisor. Using the Chrome Extension Webscraper.io and the JSON file scrapeJSON, was able to scrape all the pages with reviews mentioning GOT and the rest of the reviews. After cleaning using OpenRefine, I formatted te data for each attraction seperately as .csv files.
